# CIFO_PROJECT_Breaking-CNNs-MNIST-Dataset


On deep neural networks the convolutional neural network (CNN) has become the state-of-the-art method for image recognition. However, this method is sensitive to small perturbations, meaning that they can be easily fooled by adversarial attacks and classify images incorrectly.

On this project it is going to be shown the effect of GA by creating adversarial examples. These images are going to be created using MNIST dataset. The test dataset is going to be evolved using the main operators of GA and the goal is to make CNN model classify images incorrectly. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 shows the GA Operators, the fitness function and the constants used in this project. Section 3 describes the results of our experiments. On Section 4 and 5 are presented the conclusions and the propose for future work respectively.
